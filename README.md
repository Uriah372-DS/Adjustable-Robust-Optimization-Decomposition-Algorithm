# Adjustable-Robust-Optimization-Decomposition-Algorithm
An (attempt at) implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper "Decomposition for adjustable robust linear optimization subject to uncertainty polytope" by Josette Ayoub &amp; Michael Poss.

Coded in PICOS, and solved using the CPLEX solver (with academic license).
